Introduction
➢ Ministry of Health & Family Welfare
(MoH&FW) notified the Electronic
Health Record (EHR) Standards for India
in Sept 2013
➢ The notified standards were not only
supported by professional bodies,
regulatory bodies, stakeholders, but
various technical and social
commentators also
➢ Revised EHR Standards for India were
notified in Dec 2016

➢ For a health record of an individual to be clinically meaningful it needs to be from
conception or birth, at the very least
➢ Record of every clinical encounter (health-related event) can collectively provide a
summary of the various healthcare events in the life of a person
➢ An Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a collection of various medical records that get
generated during any clinical encounter or events
➢ Purpose of collecting medical records, as much as possible, are manifold:
• Better and evidence based care
• Increasingly accurate and faster diagnosis
• Avoid repeating unnecessary tests
• Predictive analytics to support personalized care
• Improved health policy decisions
• Better understanding of the underlying issues
• All translating into improved personal and public health
➢ Without standards, a lifelong interoperable medical record is hardly interoperable5

• EHR Standards for India (2016) provides a structured overview of the key
EHR standards with respect to Indian healthcare system
• Detailed recommendation on the various aspects of EHR systems
standardization perspective
• Short guideline regarding implementation specific to the item-in-context
included
• It is understood that with proper adoption interoperability of both
meaning and data can be achieved.
• Aim: Any person in India can go to any health service provider/practitioner,
any diagnostic center or any pharmacy and yet be able to access and have
fully integrated and always available health records in an electronic format
